## Project Overview: Google Play Description (For more info please see attached pdf file)
This app is inspired from the Google Play social impact apps✔️ through this app we want to solve one the of most common issue faced by all of us i.e. congestion or blocked road because of wrong parked vehicle✖️.

Wrong parking is the root cause of road congestion, accidents, traffic jams,
environmental pollution etc.

👉 Congestion: Wrong parking takes considerable street space leading to the
lowering of the road capacity. Hence, speed will be reduced, journey time and
delay will also subsequently increase. The operational cost of the vehicle
increases leading to great economical loss to the community.

👉 Accidents: Careless maneuvering of parking and unparking leads to accidents
which are referred to as parking accidents. Common type of parking accidents
occurs while driving out a car from the parking area, careless opening of the doors
of parked cars, and while bringing in the vehicle to the parking lot for parking.

👉 Environmental pollution: They also cause pollution to the environment because
stopping and starting of vehicles while parking and unparking results in noise and
fumes. They also affect the aesthetic beauty of the buildings because cars parked
at every available space creates a feeling that building rises from a plinth of cars.

👉 Obstruction to emergency operations: Parked vehicles may obstruct the
movement of firefighting vehicles. Sometimes they block access to hydrants and
access to buildings.

With the help of our app, we can together solve these problems

Because we believe that transportation solution should be safe, rapid,
comfortable, convenient, economical, and eco-friendly.
